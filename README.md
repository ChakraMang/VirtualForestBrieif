# Virtual Forest Brief

Virtual Forest is a web-based game designed to provide an engaging experience while contributing to real-world tree plantation efforts. By playing this game, you can actively participate in growing a virtual forest and learn interesting facts about nature.

## Overview

The objective of Virtual Forest is to grow a thriving forest by planting virtual tree seeds on a dynamic map. Each player receives one seed every day, which they can strategically plant anywhere on the map. The game emphasizes the importance of daily care for the planted seeds.

## Game Mechanics

1. Planting Seeds: Players can plant one seed per day. By selecting a suitable location on the virtual map, they initiate the growth process.

2. Daily Watering: Once a seed is planted, it must be watered every day within 24 hours. Failure to water a seed results in its death. Consistent care is essential to ensure successful growth.

3. Sapling Stage: After two days of consistent watering, a seed evolves into a sapling. Players will witness the progress as their efforts begin to bear fruit.

4. Tree Maturity: On the 15th day, the sapling grows into a magnificent tree. At this stage, the tree no longer requires watering and becomes eligible for minting as a non-fungible token (NFT).

## Installation and Usage

To set up Virtual Forest on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Add env files having the Mongo DB url.
4. Launch the APIs by executing `npm start`.
